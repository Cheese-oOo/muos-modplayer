# MUOS Mod Player: Because Your Ears Deserve Retro (and Maybe a Little Pain)

Welcome to the MUOS Mod Player, where we celebrate the glorious, sometimes ear-splitting, world of module music. Built with LÖVE2D, this player lets you relive the days of tracker software and 8-bit wonders.

## Features (or, "Why You're Still Here")

-   Plays those ancient module formats (.mod, .xm, .s3m, etc.) like a champ. Or, at least, it tries really hard.
-   Directory navigation, because finding your music should be an adventure, not a simple task.
-   Play/pause! Because sometimes you need a break from the chiptune chaos.
-   Displays the song title... if it can figure it out. (Spoiler: it usually can't)
-   A Gameboy-inspired dark gray theme, because who needs color when you have nostalgia?
-   Navigation instructions, because even we admit this thing isn't intuitive.

## Getting Started (or, "How to Make Your Computer Sing the Old Ways")

### Prerequisites (or, "Stuff You Need Before the Magic Happens")

-   LÖVE2D. If you don't have it, go get it. We'll wait... (Seriously, we will.)

### Running the Player (or, "Let the Retro Games Begin")

1.  Download this repo. Or clone it. Whatever floats your boat.
2.  Dump your module files into the `content` folder. Subdirectories? Sure, why not make it complicated?
3.  Open a terminal. If you don't know what that is, maybe skip this.
4.  Navigate to the folder with `main.lua`. (Hint: `cd your/path/here`)
5.  Run it with LÖVE2D: `love .` (Don't forget the dot!)

## Controls (or, "How to Not Get Lost in the Matrix")

-   **Up/Down:** Select things. Maybe a file. Maybe a folder. Who knows?
-   **Return:** Enter a folder, or play a song. If it works.
-   **Backspace:** Go back. Like, back in time.
-   **Space:** Play/Pause. Because sometimes you just need silence.
- (Real button maps soon!)

## File Structure (or, "Where We Hide the Secrets")

-   `main.lua`: The heart of the beast.
-   `content/`: Your musical graveyard.

## Customization (or, "Making It Slightly Less Ugly")

Feel free to mess with the colors in `main.lua`. If you make it worse, that's on you.

## Supported Formats (or, "The Alphabet Soup of Module Music")

We support a bunch. If your favorite isn't here, blame the 90s.

## Known Issues (or, "Things We're Too Lazy to Fix")

-   Metadata? What's that?
-   Error handling? We prefer to live dangerously.
-   Basically, it's a miracle it runs at all.
-   An exit

## Future Enhancements (or, "Things We'll Probably Never Do")

-   Add metadata support. (Maybe.)
-   Make it less buggy. (Doubtful.)
-   Add a UI that doesn't look like it was designed in MS Paint. (Unlikely.)
-   Volume control? Playlists? Visualizations? Don't hold your breath.

## Credits (or, "Who to Blame")

-   Cheese. Because who else?

## License (or, "The Legal Stuff You Won't Read")

 GPL-3.0 license. Just don't blame us if your computer explodes.
